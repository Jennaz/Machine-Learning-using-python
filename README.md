# Machine-Learning-using-python
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

Instructors: Andrew Ng is Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford; Chief Scientist of Baidu; and Chairman and Co-founder of Coursera.  His machine learning course is the MOOC that had led to the founding of Coursera! 

In Coursera Machine learning class, we used Octave to slove the HW problems. In here, I use python (scikit learn) to slove the problems.
